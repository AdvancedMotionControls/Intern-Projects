Project #1 Duplication Checker (dupeChecker.cs, dupeCheckerTests.cs)
  A program designed to catch duplicate variable initializations in AMC .adf files. Used by providing a complete filepath or directory      location through the command line. The program prints to the console those variables associated sections which contain variables that were accidentally duplicately initialized.
